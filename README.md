# Take Advantage of Ramadan!

ðŸ’¡ **In the Blessed Month of Ramadan, Letâ€™s Launch an Anti-Porn App!**

ðŸš€ Ramadan is a golden opportunity to do good that lasts beyond the month. I have an idea for a charity project that could save thousands from the dangers of pornography, and Iâ€™m sharing it with you in hopes that developers, designers, and tech enthusiasts will bring it to life.

## The Problem:
Online pornography is spreading rapidly, and most filtering apps are weak and easily bypassed. This Ramadan, the goal is to launch a powerful, 100% free, open-source app to block pornographic content on Android and Windows, ensuring it cannot be removed or bypassed easily.

## Key Features of the App:
- ðŸ”¹ Blocks pornographic websites completely using a locked DNS system.
- ðŸ”¹ Prevents VPN use and network modifications to stop circumvention.
- ðŸ”¹ Cannot be uninstalled without a password or after a set period.
- ðŸ”¹ 100% Free to fight against the pornography industry.
- ðŸ”¹ Open-source so the community can improve and develop it further.

ðŸŒ™ **In Ramadan, rewards are multiplied, and the opportunity to leave a lasting impact is greater than ever!**

## How Can You Help?
- ðŸ“Œ If you are a developer, consider contributing to building the app.
- ðŸ“Œ If you are a designer or content creator, help spread the message.
- ðŸ“Œ If you are active online, share this initiative and get others involved.

Letâ€™s make this happen and create something that will make a real difference.
